## Acknowledgments

This was a simple university project written in C.

All information is stored locally on same machine (users, stats and items) @ ~\labc_sm_data

In order to log in into the server for the first time the starting user will be:

Username: gestor  
Password: admin

It is possible to reset the stock, stats and registered users info by running the server with the following arguments (in-case something goes wrong unnexpectedly)

```
.\sv.out reset target
```

Target can be either:
users, stats or stocks
